# Private Multiparty Perception for Navigation
We introduce a framework for navigating through cluttered environments by connecting multiple cameras together while simultaneously preserving privacy via multi-party computation. More information can be found on the project website https://visualmpc.cs.columbia.edu/.

# Run experiments
To generate new training datasets:

`bash run_gen_dataset.sh`

To test existing models:

`bash run_test.sh`

Models can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f7FMLwfXQzNSNLOVdWfSi2sYYZarSbl3?usp=sharing and put under the root directory of the file.
